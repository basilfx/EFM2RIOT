## Pull requests
Do not make pull requests on the `dist/` folder. This output will be
overwritten. Instead, create a pull request for the source file(s) in
`efm2riot/`

## Templates
In `efm2riot/templates/`, the template files exist.
[Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) is used for converting templates to source.

### Ordering
Try to order per-board features alphabetically.

### Exclusion
Some boards may have features that others do not. Try to be explicit when
listing features, which means that you should not use the `not` operator to
exclude a single board for a particular feature, but instead should include the
ones that have that feature. This way, it is less likely that adding new boards
will result in broken compilations.

### Whitespace control
The output of the source files *has* to be 'beautiful'. This means that
whitespaces and newlines should be controlled explicitly. This can be hard
while preserving readability of the source files.

The two problems are solved by the `{% strip n, s %}{% endstrip %}` tag. The
parameter `n` strips `n` times four spaces from all resulting lines. The `s`
parameter is optional. When it is equal to `<` or `>`, it will remove one
redundant whitespace before or after the block when the block renders empty.

#### Without `strip` block

```c
// Some other code

{% if condition %}
    /**
     * @brief   Define for enabling Advanced Energy Monitor core output via SWO.
     */
    #define AEM_ENABLED
{% endif %}

// Some other code
```

If condition is true, the above block would render as:

```c
// Some other code

    /**
     * @brief   Define for enabling Advanced Energy Monitor core output via SWO.
     */
    #define AEM_ENABLED

// Some other code
```

Or, if condition is false:

```c
// Some other code


// Some other code
```

#### With `strip` block

```c
// Some other code

{% strip 2, ">" %}
    {% if condition %}
        /**
         * @brief   Define for enabling Advanced Energy Monitor core output via SWO.
         */
        #define AEM_ENABLED
    {% endif %}
{% endstrip %}

// Some other code
```

If `condition` is true, the above block would render as:

```c
// Some other code

/**
 * @brief   Define for enabling Advanced Energy Monitor core output via SWO.
 */
#define AEM_ENABLED

// Some other code
```

Or, if `condition` is false:

```c
// Some other code

// Some other code
```
